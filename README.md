# 🌐 Understanding Localhost and Port Numbers (127.0.0.1:8080)

Ever wanted to test your own website without uploading it to the internet?  
That's where **localhost** comes in!

## 🧠 What is Localhost?

- `localhost` refers to **your own computer**.
- It is used to **run and test websites or apps locally**.
- Its IP address is `127.0.0.1` – also called the **loopback address**.
- When you use `localhost`, your browser connects directly to your PC, not to the internet.

🖥️ Think of it like this:
> "You're sending a letter to yourself — and reading it at home."

## 🔢 What is Port 8080? (`localhost:8080`)

- The number after `:` (like `8080`) is a **port number**.
- A **port** is like a channel or gate that lets your computer talk to a specific service.
- Example:
  - `localhost:80` → Default HTTP (web) server.
  - `localhost:8080` → Often used for local development.
  - `localhost:3000` → Used by tools like React, Node.js, etc.

📦 Each port is a **different service or app** on your machine.
